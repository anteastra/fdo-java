<div align="left"><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1.1 License Grant. Microsoft
grants to you as an individual, a personal nonexclusive license to make and use
copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT for the sole purposes of evaluating and learning
how to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, as may be instructed in accompanying

valid license you have acquired for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you may install a
single copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on a single computer for access and use by
an unlimited number of student end users at your educational institution,
provided that all such end users comply with all other terms of this EULA, OR

such use is limited to student or faculty end users at your educational
institution and provided that all such end users comply with all other terms of
this EULA. For purposes of this subsection, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is "in use" on
a computer when it is loaded into the temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed
into the permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD ROM, or other storage device) of
that computer, except that a copy installed on a network server for the sole
purpose of distribution to other computers is not "in use". If the anticipated
number of users of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will exceed the number of applicable
licenses, then you must have a reasonable mechanism or process in place to
ensure that the number of persons using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT concurrently does
not exceed the number of licenses.</font><br></p></div>

efforts to solve any problem. To the extent allowed by applicable law, implied

of the CD, you must treat this software just like a book. However, you may copy
it onto a computer to be used and you may make archival copies of the software

from loss. By saying, "just like a book," MindView, Inc. means, for example,
that this software may be used by any number of people and may be freely moved
from one computer location to another, so long as there is no possibility of its
being used at one location or on one computer while it is being used at another.
Just as a book cannot be read by two different people in two different places at
the same time, neither can the software be used by two different people in two
different places at the same time.</font><br></p></div>

loss, damages, or costs arising from the use of the CD or the interpretation of
the Content. Some states do not allow exclusion or limitation of implied
warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
so all of the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to
you.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2">In no event shall MindView, Inc.
